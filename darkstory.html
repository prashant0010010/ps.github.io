                        My mother told me about the old world. Before the flood. She said it had been of a different kind. She would braid my hair and recount harrowing 
                        tales, of my father and of demons from the underworld. She said, “All is forgiven but nothing is forgotten.” The darkness in her eyes was 
                        greater than usual. And her words flowed like waves.
                        She said all was well now the way it was. <br> <br>
                      That all occupied its own space in the past as in here and now. When she spoke in this manner, something would overcome here. 
                      She would pull my braids tightly as if to punish me for something that dwelled in a place deep within her. Something that tugged 
                      at her from the center, like a hunger that could not be satisfied. She spoke of yesterday as though it were before her very eyes. 
                      As if today she was but a veil that shrouded in shadow all that was real to her. 
                      Then the old world came to haunt her like a ghost that whispered to her in a dream how to erect the new world stone by stone. <br><br>
                      From then on, I knew that nothing changes that all things remain as before. The spinning wheel turns, round and round in a circle. 
                      One fate tied to the next. A thread, red like blood, which cleaves together all over deeds. One cannot unravel the knots. But they can be 
                      severed. He severed ours with a sharpest blade. 
                      Yet something remains behind that cannot be severed. An invisible bond. On many a night, he tugs at it. And then I wake with a start, 
                      knowing that nothing ceases to be.
                        That all remains……………………
